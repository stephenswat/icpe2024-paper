abstract="Achieving optimal program performance requires deep insight into the interaction between hardware and software. For software developers without an in-depth background in computer architecture, understanding and fully utilizing modern architectures is close to impossible. Analytic loop performance modeling is a useful way to understand the relevant bottlenecks of code execution based on simple machine models. The Roofline Model and the Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) model are proven approaches to performance modeling of loop nests. In comparison to the Roofline model, the ECM model can also describes the single-core performance and saturation behavior on a multicore chip.We give an introduction to the Roofline and ECM models, and to stencil performance modeling using layer conditions (LC). We then present Kerncraft, a tool that can automatically construct Roofline and ECM models for loop nests by performing the required code, data transfer, and LC analysis. The layer condition analysis allows to predict optimal spatial blocking factors for loop nests. Together with the models it enables an ab-initio estimate of the potential benefits of loop blocking optimizations and of useful block sizes. In cases where LC analysis is not easily possible, Kerncraft supports a cache simulator as a fallback option. Using a 25-point long-range stencil we demonstrate the usefulness and predictive power of the Kerncraft tool.",

abstract = {Abstract Two-dimensional arrays are generally arranged in memory in row-major order or column-major order. Traversing a row-major array in column-major order, or vice versa, leads to poor spatial locality. With large arrays the performance loss can be a factor of 10 or more. This paper explores the Morton storage layout, which has substantial spatial locality whether traversed in row-major or column-major order. Using a small suite of dense kernels working on two-dimensional arrays, we have carried out an extensive study of the impact of poor array layout and of whether Morton layout can offer an attractive compromise. We show that Morton layout can lead to better performance than the worse of the two canonical layouts; however, the performance of Morton layout compared to the better choice of canonical layout is often disappointing. We further study one simple improvement of the basic Morton scheme: we show that choosing the correct alignment for the base address of an array in Morton layout can sometimes significantly improve the competitiveness of this layout.

abstract = {Modern microarchitectures are some of the world's most complex man-made systems. As a consequence, it is increasingly difficult to predict, explain, let alone optimize the performance of software running on such microarchitectures. As a basis for performance predictions and optimizations, we would need faithful models of their behavior, which are, unfortunately, seldom available. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a tool to construct faithful models of the latency, throughput, and port usage of x86 instructions. To this end, we first discuss common notions of instruction throughput and port usage, and introduce a more precise definition of latency that, in contrast to previous definitions, considers dependencies between different pairs of input and output operands. We then develop novel algorithms to infer the latency, throughput, and port usage based on automatically-generated microbenchmarks that are more accurate and precise than existing work. To facilitate the rapid construction of optimizing compilers and tools for performance prediction, the output of our tool is provided in a machine-readable format. We provide experimental results for processors of all generations of Intel's Core architecture, i.e., from Nehalem to Coffee Lake, and discuss various cases where the output of our tool differs considerably from prior work.},

abstract = {Graphics processors (GPUs) have emerged as an important platform for general purpose computing. GPUs offer a large number of parallel cores and have access to high memory bandwidth; however, data structure layouts in GPU memory often lead to suboptimal performance for programs designed with a CPU memory interface---or no particular memory interface at all!---in mind. This implies that application performance is highly sensitive irregularity in memory access patterns. This issue is all the more important due to the growing disparity between core and DRAM clocks; memory interfaces have increasingly become bottlenecks in computer systems.In this paper, we propose a simple API, Dymaxion, that allows programmers to optimize memory mappings to improve the efficiency of memory accesses on heterogeneous platforms. Use of Dymaxion requires only minimal modifications to existing CUDA programs. Our current framework extends NVIDIA's CUDA API with the addition of memory layout remapping and index transformation. We consider the overhead of layout remapping and effectively hide it through chunking and overlapping with PCI-E transfer. We present the implementation of Dymaxion and its optimizations and evaluate a variety of important memory access patterns. Using four case studies, we are able to achieve 3.3x speedup on GPU kernels and 20% overall performance improvement, including the PCI-E transfer, over the original CUDA implementations on an NVIDIA GTX 480 GPU. We also explore the importance of maintaining per-device data layouts and cross-device data mappings with a case study of concurrent CPU-GPU execution.},

abstract="The performance of irregular applications on modern computer systems is hurt by the wide gap between CPU and memory speeds because these applications typically under-utilize multi-level memory hierarchies, which help hide this gap. This paper investigates using data and computation reorderings to improve memory hierarchy utilization for irregular applications. We evaluate the impact of reordering on data reuse at different levels in the memory hierarchy. We focus on coordinated data and computation reordering based on space-filling curves and we introduce a new architecture-independent multi-level blocking strategy for irregular applications. For two particle codes we studied, the most effective reorderings reduced overall execution time by a factor of two and four, respectively. Preliminary experience with a scatter benchmark derived from a large unstructured mesh application showed that careful data and computation ordering reduced primary cache misses by a factor of two compared to a random ordering.",

abstract = {Cloud object stores such as Amazon S3 are some of the largest and most cost-effective storage systems on the planet, making them an attractive target to store large data warehouses and data lakes. Unfortunately, their implementation as key-value stores makes it difficult to achieve ACID transactions and high performance: metadata operations such as listing objects are expensive, and consistency guarantees are limited. In this paper, we present Delta Lake, an open source ACID table storage layer over cloud object stores initially developed at Databricks. Delta Lake uses a transaction log that is compacted into Apache Parquet format to provide ACID properties, time travel, and significantly faster metadata operations for large tabular datasets (e.g., the ability to quickly search billions of table partitions for those relevant to a query). It also leverages this design to provide high-level features such as automatic data layout optimization, upserts, caching, and audit logs. Delta Lake tables can be accessed from Apache Spark, Hive, Presto, Redshift and other systems. Delta Lake is deployed at thousands of Databricks customers that process exabytes of data per day, with the largest instances managing exabyte-scale datasets and billions of objects.},
